This is a WIP project meant to scrape twitter and analyze
tweets for their sentiment using NLP. As of now, the code doesn't do 
much apart from connecting  to twitter's API to get tweets. I'm
currently working on cleaning the data before adding the sentiment 
analysis.


Ideally, this program will be fully interactive with a GUI and will
output the data in the form of graphs and charts.



Prerequisites

-Python 3
-tweepy
-regex
-twitter developer account



Running the code

The most important thing you'll need is a twitter developer account.
Just copy your keys into the twitter_api.p file and everything should 
work. As I stated before, in its current state the code doesn't do much
but it does run so go crazy!
